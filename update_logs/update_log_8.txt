Key bindings were added in "game_projectGameModeBase.cpp" by benefiting two internet sources [1] [2] [4].
But while trying to remove previous key bindings, some errors happened.
One of them was read in output log as "LogOutputDevice: Error: Array has changed during ranged-for iteration!".
To solve them, two range_based for loops converted to two standart for loops by using two codes from a webpage [5][6].
Output logs were used to see which elements were assigned by using "UE_LOG" and different usages of this functions, were learned from a tutorial webpage [7].
Looking with mouse and jumping, was not working and solutions which are changing some "FInputAxisKeyMapping" paramaters and adding new looking functions, were found by examining a tutorial [8] and a source code [9].
Two new variables were added for increasing looking rate after examining a source code [10].
After changing Game Mode and key bindings, remaining previous key binding were noticed but this problem could not fixed.
Unreal Engine crashed again after restarting the editor and the problem which is about "GEngine", was fixed by commenting "check(GEngine != nullptr);" line in "game_projectGameModeBase.cpp"
