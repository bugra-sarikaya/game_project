An empty map is created and tried to build every component but failed.
To find solutions, forum pages were searched and found Blueprints solutions.
Preference of making this game, was C++ coding and because Blueprints is visual scripting, those solutions weren't preferred.
Lack of C++ solutions, that situtation was searched and found that programming a game using completely C++ is possible but it's not recommended [1][2].
However, searching C++ solutions were continued.
An unofficial tutorial was found but it didn't worked [3].
Lack of C++ solutions, a Blueprints solution were tried and to make a retro game with no shadows, attempted to play the game with unlit mode by using a bluprint solution but it didn't worked [4].
An official C++ tutorial from Unreal Engine was found and its first step was skipped to pass level setup because a map and its simple constructions were already set up [5].
Implementing second step on existing map, failed and the project was recreated to start with first step.
First step of official tutorial, was applied successfully [6].
After fixing a problem which was encountered by using a forum solution, second step was applied successfully [7][8].
Because in second step of official C++ tutorial a Blueprint class was created for editor to recognize, impossibility of programming a game without Blueprints, was understood.
