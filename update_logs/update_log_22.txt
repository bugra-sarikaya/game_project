A video [1] was watched for creating a main menu and its Blueprint implementations was applied successfully to develop a pure C++ game, a few more video were butched.
Any tutorial and any documentation could not be found for developing a main menu witch pure C++ codes.
It was observed that tutorials usign widgets for main menus but it was thought that proper way to add a main menu, is creating a HUD for this game project.
A basic implemention of main menu HUD, was read in a webpage of Unreal Engine forum.
Blueprints of adding hit box feature, were examined on a video [3].
"ReceiveHitBoxClick" function could not be used and instead of this function, "NotifyHitBoxClick" function was overrided by benefiting a webpage [14].
While trying to add a HUD, a problem about switching Game Modes, was noticed.
Game was not changing Game Modes after changing level and after a long research, the problem was solved by adding modified class reference of Game Mode into options of "OpenLevel" function according to an advice from Unreal Engine forum [5].
Inserting text feature of Aseprite, was learned from a webpage [6].
2 buttons were drawn on Aseprite and their font type was set to "Press Start" font which was found in local computer.
A code line was found to quit game from another webpage of Unreal Engine [7].
For a background color "FColor" struct was used instead of "FlinearColor" by benefiting a tutorial [8] and RGB code found from an image [9] of a webpage [10].
Simple main menu HUD was completed.
Name of some source file were changed.
