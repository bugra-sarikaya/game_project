"check(GEngine != nullptr);" line was deleted from "paper_character.cpp" because internet tutors who were watched, was not writing that.
"paper_component->bCastDynamicShadow = false;" line was deleted from "paper_character.cpp" because its redundancy when "CastShadow" is set true, was learned from the documentation [1].
EMG Mark V pistol [2] from a concept art [3] of DOOM (2016), was decided to draw as pixel version.
A photograph [4] from a webpage [5], was taken as a reference to draw a holding hand.
While colorizing the artwork, a method which was found in a forum page [6], was implemented for working with two windows in Aseprite.
To choose a hand color, main protagonist of Viscerafest, was inspired and her hand's image [7] was found in a news website [8].
A new folder was created and it has Aseprite projects.
The artwork's canvas size was 256x256px and the image was exported as resizing to 600%.
"paper_character" was changed to "paper_player" by renaming file names, constructors and including directives but Unreal Engine did not recognize it and to solve that, a method which have found [9] and used for deleting C++ classes before, was implemented.
Two codes which are from two videos [10] [11], was tried to implemented for building "paper_player" but compiler gave C2664 error.
Solution was found in a forum webpage [12] and "PaperFlipbook.h" was included into "paper_player.h"
While restarting project, Unreal Engine crashed and it gave "EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION" error.
Including "Engine.h" solution which was found a forum webpage [13], did not work but commenting the line of "GEngine", worked.
Instead of "GEngine", "UE_LOG" function was used by benefiting forum answer [14] and this method was inspired from a monologue sentence in a forum webpage [15].
"fps_hud" was changed to "combat_hud".
After restarting project, default pawn and crosshair were disabled to be selected in Project Settings and to solve this, a default pawn class was added manually into "game_projectGameModeBase" by using a solution from a webpage [16].
HUD Class was failed to add manually and the solution which is including "GameFramework/HUD.h", was applied in a forum webpage [17].
A new crosshair was drawed by using Aseprite.
Canvas size was 16x16px and image was exported as resizing to 200%.
A useful source codes for building a HUD, was found on internet [18] but previous HUD codes was used for new crosshair.
After many tries for locating the pistol by using "F8" (TPS mode), "F11" (Fullscreen for play mode) and "Shift + F11" (Fulscreen for window) shortcuts, its location, rotation and scale were adjusted successfully as "FVector(20.0f, 4.7f, -6.7f)", "(FRotator(0.0f, 90.0, 0.0f))" and "FVector(0.008f)".
