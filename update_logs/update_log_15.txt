Creating enemy of a YouTube tutorial [1] was watched again for creating enemy AI.
While adding "on_hit" function "AddDynamic" macro gave an error and to solve it, parameters of "on_hit" function was changed according to an Unreal Engine forum webpage [2].
It was decided that Anim Class will not be created because there are not any animation settings on flipbook details.
A part of Unreal Engine documentation [3] which is about initializations in header files, was read and it was decided that some initializations are in header files.
Two internet sources [4] [5] was read shortly for finding a possibility of property specifiers without tags and using empty property specifiers was decided.
A problem which is about not displaying last sprite of pistol fire flipbook, was detected and to solve it, sprite sheet of pistol was changed and some "PAPER2UPaperFlipbookComponent" functions were used.
Size of the floor in test map, was increased for testing enemy AI.
It was learned that after setting flipbook looping variable to false and after flipbook is finished, "IsPlaying()" function returns false even if flipbook is changed and "Play()" function should be used after that every looping settings.
Including header files whose ends like ".generated.h", were noticed and their function was learnt in a Unreal Engine forum webpage [6].
An error which is about circular depencencies, was occured and a method which is creating a third file for solving, was found in a Unreal Engine forum webpage [7] but instead of that, other classes' headers files were included only in files with ".cpp" extension as the tutor of first tutorial [1], did.
After installing Visual Studio 2022, Unreal Engine editor setting for IDE, was changed by benefiting an internet video [8].
Scene component of projectile class was deleted because any benefits of scene component for this project, were not seen in a documentation webpage of Unreal Engine [9].
Some codes of projectile class were changed according to first tutorial [1].
After a projectile hits the enemy, the enemy was not dying and changing "OnComponentHit()" function to "OnComponentBeginOverlap()" function as the YouTuber did, solved this issue.
But previously, there was a feature which is being destroyed after hit static mesh and this feature was lost after setting components of projectile.
To get the lost feature, collision response settings were changed to block everything for projectile and after this adjustment "OnComponentHit()" function was usef for destroying projectile and enemy.
In this update, Enemy AI was created but it has some problems.
