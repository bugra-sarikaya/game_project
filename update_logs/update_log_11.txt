Initializations in "paper_player.h", were moved to "paper_player.cpp".
"Paper_player" was not able to shoot a projectile and the reason of this which is unloaded class, was found.
The projectile class was loaded by using "LoadClass()" function.
After witnessing fired sphere projectiles, a simple pixel projectile was drawn.
Canvas size of pixel projectile, was 32x32px and it was exported as resizing to 300%.
The pixel projectile was added to game but its rotation was not convenient for viewing.
"FindLookAtRotation()" function was found in a forum webpage [1] to solve the issue.
Its usage example [2] which was found in Unreal Engine forum webpage [3], was used but it did not work.
By inspring the example, "SetWorldRotation()" function which has an argument of camera rotation, was used instead of "SetRelativeRotation()", to change projectile's rotation and it worked.
Also, for changing roll rotation of projectile, pitch rotation of camera, was used.
"Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour" was played for examining rotations of paper enemies and it was decided that enemies of Duke Nukem game and the projectile have similar dynamic rotation.
To draw a firing animation for pistol, a new layers and frames were added into Asepprite project.
Angry Sun from Super Mario series [4], was inspired to draw a muzzle blast.
Two videos about frames[5] and layers [6] in Aseprite, were watched.
For drawing recoil animation, rotating method was tried and disruption which occured after rotating, was tried to fixed but the disruption could not fixed completely.
Some gun sheets [7] [8] [9] on the internet, were examined, it was thought that reason of that disruption, is that image is izometric and pixelated.
There was a solution which is drawing the image again as positioning to bottom middle of the screen like weapons of DOOM game but diagonal moving method, was preferred.
A video [10] about exporting sprite sheets, was watched.
A YouTube video [11] for remembering flipbook adjustment, was watched and a flipbook of pistol fire was created.
Firing animation was added into C++ files by using "LoadObject()" function.
Changing flipbook while firing, was succeeded but after firing, animation of paper gun, did not change to idle animation.
Some solutions which are using timers with delegates, using "OnFinishedPlaying()" function and using "SetLooping()" function, were tried but they did not work.
Solution was found in a website [12] and by using last frame position of playing flipbook, problem was solved.
