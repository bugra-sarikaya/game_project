While jumping, it was noticed that weapon sliding was not working.
Weapon sliding with actor location and rotation, was dediced to applied again.
To implement it while jumping, "GetVelocity()" function was written instead of "GetLastMovementInputVector()" function.
Vector values were observed with "UE_LOG" and it was found that "UnrotateVector()" function was giving error less 0.01f value.
Tolerances were determined to 0.01f and -0.01 values for X and Y axes and after adding previous codes, a successful result was obtained finally.
A tutorial [1] for camera shaking have be found before, but its "Camera Shake" class did not found in current Unreal Engine version which is 4.27.2.
A tutorial video [2] was found and it was learned that choosing "MatineeCameraShake" class is proper way.
For adding a camera shake, some useful codes were found in several sources but any direct solution was not found because most of solutions were Blueprint methods.
By inspiring generic class declarations in "game_projectGameModeBase.cpp" file an benefiting "LoadClass()" function which was found in a forum page [3], a "TSubclassOf<UMatineeCameraShake>" variable was declared in header file of "paper_player" and created camera shake class was loaded to it. 
For using "StartMatineeCameraShake()" function without the scope resolution operator, a class pointer declared in header file.
After struggling to implement a camera shake for a long time, a direct solution was found in a GitHub repository [4], hilariously.
For implementing camera shake while moving on ground, "Is Moving On Ground" function was found in Unreal Engine documentation [5].
Because the function is for Blueprint, C++ version of the function was obtained in "CharacterMovementComponent.cpp" file after pressing "Goto Definition" option on the function's node in Level Blueprint and its usage example from a forum page [6], was utilized.
But it was learnt that function does not check actor's moving as its name and it just checks actor to be on ground.
"Velocity.Size()" function for checking moving, was found in forum webpage [7].
"Velocity.Size()" and IsMovingOnGround()" functions were used in a "if" condition for checking movement on the ground.
A source code from a forum webpage [8] and A video [9] which have camera shake paramaters, was benefited but the parameters of the video, did not work as expected.
A simple camera shake which is similar to the first source [1], was applied but it was not liked.
While observing camera shake, a disruption on display was detected and it was solved by enabling Vsync.
Project Warlock game was watched in YouTube [10], it was noticed that it has a walking animation similar to Viscerafest's animation
After observing game, a walking animation on weapon sprite, was decided to add.
While restarting the project, the engine gave an error about dynamic resolution and to solve, "SetDynamicResolutionEnabled()" was used and alsoe "SetAntiAliasingQuality(0)" function beacome available again.
After spending some time in play mode that display corruption was noticed again and it was ignored.
Oscillation walking feature which is similar to walking animation of Project Warlock, was added successfully for camera and weapon.
