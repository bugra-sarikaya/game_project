A dark theme was installed to Aseprite for better motivation [1].
A YouTube video playlist which is about Aseprite tutorial, was watched for learning pixel art basics [2].
A test gun image [3] from a tweet [4], was added into the project contents for testing.
The image was converted to flipbook in the editor and it was attached to camera by using Blueprint.
When "FPSMesh(FirstPersonMesh) (Inherited)" component could not be deleted from blueprint of the character, it was noticed that the component have written in C++ class.
Also, while examining "fps_character" C++ class, it was noticed that C++ classes are recognizable without their blueprint files for the editor, because in Project Settings, changing "bp_fps_character" to "fps_character" for "Default Pawn Class", was witnessed.
Instead of changing codes of "fps_character" class, a new C++ class whose parent class is PaperCharacters was created.
Source files of the new C++ class whose name is "paper_character", was edited by copying the codes of "fps_character" class.
Instead of "USkeletalMeshComponent", "UPaperFlipbookComponent" was written, according to a YouTube tutorial video [5].
After changing previous "FPSMesh" lines to "paper_component" lines, Visual Studio gave an error and it was fixed with the solution of including "PaperFlipbookComponent.h" file, which is found from a forum page [6].
But after building the source codes, Unreal Engine crashed with some error messages two times and the project didn't opened.
Current project files were replaced with previous project files from GitHub local repository.
"paper_character" class was rewritten by using saved source files but after build the editor crashed again.
Current project files were deleted and previous project files copied to deleted folder.
"paper_character" class was rewritten again by using source files of "fps_character" class with only difference of no gap between "#include" lines and it surprisingly didn't crash.
After this crashing situation, watching some Unreal Engine C++ tutorials, was planned.
