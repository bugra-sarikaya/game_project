3 sources were read shortly to learning object count limit for Unreal Engine and it was thought 2 million object count limit is enought for this game project.
It was decided that game will have only one level and it will be arena level.
For designing an arena map, 3 DOOM Eternal videos [4] [5] [6] were watched shortly.
To build some stairs rotating planes, was tried but it could not be found that any triangle planes in Unreal Engine editor to fill sides.
By benefiting 5 sources [7] [8] [9] [10] [11], some methods were found for making a triangle plane but they were able to set an angle to 30 degrees
Blender program could be usable to adjust angles and from a video tutorial [12], exporting and importing processes between BLender and Unrel Engine, were learned.
While strugling to find a method for creating a triangle plane on Blender, it was realized that triangle plane are proper for pixel art textures because hypotenuse edges will not be smooth.
Scaling objects, was decided to implement for creating stairs.
To create unique variable name for stair plane pointers, staircase terminology was researched and 3 terms which are riser, tread and stringer, were used by beneficted from a source [13]
A video [14] was watched shortly for learning a spawning paramater.
In this update an algorithm for creating a stair, was completed but process took long time unexpectedly.
Developing methods of this game, may change if processes are not be facilitated.
