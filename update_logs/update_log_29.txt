A video [1] about exporting game, was watched and instructions of video were applied but result was a black screen.
Another video [2] about exporting, was watched and its instructions was applied for changin exporting details but it did not work.
A long was research was done and all advices from internet, except creating a new project, was tried but success could not be obtained.
While examining logs, warnings about uninitialized members of defined material structs, were noticed and to solve this, values of "nullptr" were assigned to uninitialized material pointers.
Also new source files were created for struct fields.
Game was playable on editor but still it was not playable on desktop and changing default Game Mode, to Game Mode of main menu was fixed this issue.
But somehow it was noticed that alert sound was played beginning of the arena level and this problem was never occurring in play mode of editor.
To solve untimely alert sound, health variable of player state, was initialized as "100.0f".
Some unused contents were deleted.
From 3 sources, advices about changing content of "DefaultEngine.ini" file, were learned but advices were nort work for solving black screen problem with default Game Mode.
Fire rate was increased to "1.1f" from "1.0f".
Some sound multiplier values were changed.
Projectile speed was increased but its damage value was decreased.
Finally game was exported successfully and a playthrough video was recorded.
