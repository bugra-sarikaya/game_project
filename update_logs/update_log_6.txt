An uncompleted video playlist which is about Unreal Engine C++ tutorial, was watched [1] and it showed that usage of Unreal Engine, is possible without using Blueprints.
Also, thanks to the video playlist, it was learned that the names of C++ functions are similar to the names of Blueprint nodes and they can be found in source codes of Unreal Engine.
Two video guides about converting Blueprints to C++ nodes, were watched [2] [3] but they didn't give new ideas.
Two tutorials about paper character, were watched [4] [5].
A YouTube video about comparison of Blueprints and C++, was watched [6].
A method for converting Blueprints to C++ codes node by node, was found in a discussion webpage [7].
But the method of clicking "Goto Defitinion", did not work and the solution which is downloading editor symbols for debugging, was found in a forum page [8].
An internet video about making PS1 graphics, was watched [9] but its instructions could not find in Unreal Engine.
A method for building unlit material was found to make the project a simple style [10].
A Blueprint tutorial about retro FPS game developing, was watched [11].
An Unreal Engine C++ video tutorial was watched [12].
Four video playlists about Unreal Engine tutorial, were watched [13] [14] [15] [16].
A video playlist about Blender tutorial, was watched [17].
Totaly 37 hours, 26 minutes and 14 seconds of content was watched.
A solution of viewing output log was found in a forum webpage [18] and any error was not found in that after compiling for analyzing previous Unreal Engine crash.
