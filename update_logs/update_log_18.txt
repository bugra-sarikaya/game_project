A Reddit webpage about performance of using multiple meshes, was read shortly [1].
An Unreal Engine forum webpage [2], was reas shortly for learning how to disconnect Blueprint nodes.
6 sources [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] were examined shortly for changing texure details of materials.
A video [10] was watched to learn selecting multiple objects.
An error occured while trying to initialize two different types in a for loop and it was solved by using a solution which is found from a webpage [10].
A material tutorial [11] was watched.
A method for sizing 2D vector, was learned form a Stack Overflow webpage [12].
While trying to declare an 2D "TArray", a problem was occured and it was learned that Unreal Engine does not support multidimensional array for its variable types like "TArray".
For providing multidimensional arrays, a method which is using structs was found in a webpage 13] of Unreal Engine forum.
Instead of using classic C/C++ arrays, using "TArray" arrays was important because Unrel Engine provides garbage collection for its own types with have macros like "UPROPERTY".
A long research was done and using struct for 2D arrays, was succeeded by benefiting 2 sources [14] [15].
To set rotation of planes, an image [16] about rotating axis was used.
Instead of entering the plane size manualy, a dynamic method was decided to implement.
After founding some useful codes [17] [18] and searching source files of the engine, size was obtained by getting box extent value of a temporary plane.
Temporary plane was destroyed after getting the size.
For creating a room, it was tried to find a method which solves a problem of moving only diagonally to pass each face of a cube, only once but it could not be found.
Creating a box room via C++ codes, was completed, instead of using editor because it was experienced that multiple object number like 10K, makes designing troublesome.
