Applying third step of the official tutorial was continued [1].
In third step, "Projectile Class" options didn't contain the coded projectile and editor was restarted to fix this solution.
After writing fire projectile codes, projectiles didn't appear in play mode and "GEngine->AddOnScreenDebugMessage(-1, 5.0f, FColor::Red, TEXT("ProjectileTest."));" line was inserted into fire function for testing.
Testing showed that fire function wasn't working properly and to fix this, key binding of fire function was moved to Action Mappings from Axis Mappings in settings of Engine - Input.
The third step was completed.
