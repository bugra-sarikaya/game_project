A video [1] about Cthon game which doesn't have any projectile trace like laser, was watched shortly.
Fire rate of the pistol, was adjusted according to fire animation as adding "paper_component->GetFlipbook() == pistol_idle_assset" condition into "if" statement.
A gameplay video [2] about alpha version of Viscerafest, was watched shortly and it was noticed that there was only pixelated projectiles.
Projectile image was re-edited as 31x31px canvas size and it was exported as resizing to 300%.
Many scale values for the projectile, was tried.
To adding a automatic feature, timer method was found on internet [3] but it could not be adapted.
Instead of timer method, a "do-while" loop which checks pressing left mouse button, was added into fire function but Unreal Engine did not respond like crashing.
It was found that reason was from "while" loop and it was converted to simple "if" statement in "Tick" function of the class.
After obtaining success, reason of crashing which is infinite loop, was found on an forum webpage [4].
Previous timer method was tried again and after changing the location of "GetWorldTimerManager().SetTimer(MyHandle, this, &Apaper_player::fire, 0.5f, true);" line to "fire" function, it worked.
Nevertheless, previous method which is checking holding left mouse button was preferred but codes of timer method were commented.
Radius of projectile's collision sphere was changed to "10.0f" but it may be changed after next updates.
Purpose of "PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;" line was found by trying to change the value to false and the purpose was activating "Tick()" function of classes.
After uninitializing gravity scale of projectile, it was witnessed that projectiles is falling.
Some parameters of projectile were declared in "projectile.h" and various values were assigned to them in "projectile.cpp"
Impulse feature of the projectile was removed but codes were commented.
